Nov 16th Meeting Notes
Attendees: Phil and Alex
Subject: GitHub Repository - data analysis - Multiple Linear Regression - end of term goals - Consider inclusion of Uncertainty Analysis with NWS perspective

To do: 
1. Start a new notebook using Multiple Linear Regression analysis to determine the significance or weighted sum of the predictors
2. Normalize variables - make them a fraction or % of the range between 0 and 1: (i.e. Runlength > 2hr = 0 and 6hr = 1 ; Resolution 0 = 5m, .4 = 7m, 1=10m)
3. Normalize everthing to 2% regression
4. Continue to build on data sample via simulations

Nov 25th Meeting Notes
Attendees: Phil and Alex
Subject:  autorun.sh script, newly committed data, MLR notebook from Phil, normalizing data and future simulations

1. Complete 3 identical runs to test similarity of output - done by AG
2. Continue to test MLR Python Notebook Phil started and - in progress
3. Continue running automated sensitivity tests in the background. - running
4. Explore random simulations in the test through random # generator with BASH - done AG
5. Consider Non-linear Regression approach - in progress
6. Explore ways to validate or fit data to Pat's impact thresholds. in progress.
