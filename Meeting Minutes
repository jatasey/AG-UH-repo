Nov 16th Meeting Notes
Attendees: Phil and Alex
Subject: GitHub Repository - data analysis - Multiple Linear Regression - end of term goals - Consider inclusion of Uncertainty Analysis with NWS perspective

To do: 
1. Start a new notebook using Multiple Linear Regression analysis to determine the significance or weighted sum of the predictors
2. Normalize variables - make them a fraction or % of the range between 0 and 1: (i.e. Runlength > 2hr = 0 and 6hr = 1 ; Resolution 0 = 5m, .4 = 7m, 1=10m)
3. Normalize everthing to 2% regression
4. Continue to build on data sample via simulations

Nov 25th Meeting Notes
Attendees: Phil and Alex
Subject:  autorun.sh script, newly committed data, MLR notebook from Phil, normalizing data and future simulations

1. Complete 3 identical runs to test similarity of output - done by AG
2. Continue to test MLR Python Notebook Phil started and - in progress
3. Continue running automated sensitivity tests in the background. - running
4. Explore random simulations in the test through random # generator with BASH - done AG
5. Consider Non-linear Regression approach - in progress
6. Explore ways to validate or fit data to Pat's impact thresholds. in progress.  

Dec 17th 2020 Meeting Notes
Attendees: Phil and Alex
Subject: Random seeding script and output 2m sample updated, LR Adv/Warning, Type of non-linear regression for multi-variables. 

1. Relate water levels used from the random generator to actual water levels relative to MHHW and MSL. 
2. Find some way to relate 2% WLEVs to impact thresholds. 
3. What can we say about the output when we know nothing about the friction. How does the output change once we know the friction. 
4. Does the NWS have actual impact water level thresholds? 
5. LR model - provide a paper from Greg.
